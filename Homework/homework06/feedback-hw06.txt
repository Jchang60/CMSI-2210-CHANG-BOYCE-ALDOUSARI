Total possible points 100

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 100.00/100.00 which is 100% which is an A-plus

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm
   when assembling, I got an error: invalid combination of opcode and operands
      I think you need to have the "10" in a register.  The rest of the code
      looks OK, but you could have used "printf()" and "scanf()" instead of
      those pesky interrupt vectors...

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c
   OOPS!  You didn't put the comments in a comment for the prototype.  I put
      that in for you.  Now it builds but when I run it the result isn't
      correct.  Running with 24 and 18 should produce "6" and returns "12"
      for the first run and "4" for the next one.

problem 3 paritygen.nasm
   this started out with two assembly errors at lines 33 and 37.  You can see
      I fixed them for you, along with the use of "_start" rather than "_main".
      now it assembles, links and runs, but I get no output.  The code looks
      correct, though.

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c
   perfect!

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c
   I can't build this on Windows since it's using Mac 64 code.  However, it
      appears like this is the correct code so full credit.

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm
   I can't build this on Windows since it's using Mac 64 code.  However, it
      appears like this is the correct code so full credit.

SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~   0.00% of  5 points =  0.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~  89.84% of  5 points =  4.49 points
   homework04 ~  95.56% of  5 points =  4.78 points
   homework05 ~  99.00% of 10 points =  9.90 points
   homework06 ~  91.00% of 15 points = 13.65 points
                       semester total: 37.82 out of 45.00 = 84.04%
                             which is a B on the total homework.

Great work on this difficult assignment!  You were smart to use win32 in the
programs instead of trying to use win64...

It's been a great pleasure having you in class and I look forward to seeing
you in future classes.  Good luck on the final!
